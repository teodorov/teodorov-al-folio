## "Model-Driven Physical-Design for Future Nanoscale Architectures"

***Abstract*** In the context where the traditional CMOS technology approaches its limits, some nanowire-based fabric proposals emerged, which all exhibit some common key characteristics. Among these, their bottom-up fabrication process leads to a regularity of assembly, which means the end of custom-made computational fabrics in favor of regular structures. Hence, research activities in this area, focus on structures conceptually similar to todayâ€™s reconfigurable PLA and/or FPGA architectures[165, 160]. A number of different fabrics and architectures are currently under investigation, e. g.CMOL[165], FPNI[160], NASIC[115]. These proof-of-concept architectures take into account some fabrication constraints and support fault-tolerance techniques. What is still missing is the ability to capitalize on these experiments while offering a one-stop shopping point for further research, especially at the physical-design level of the circuit design tool-flow. Sharing metrics, tools, and exploration capabilities is the next challenge to the nano-computing community.

We address this problem by proposing a model-driven physical-design toolkit based on the factorization of common domain-specific concepts and the reification of the tool-flow. We used this tool-flow to drive the design-space exploration in the context of a novel nanoscale architecture, and we showed that such an approach assures design convergence based on frequent quantitative evaluations, moreover, it enables incremental evolution of the architecture and the automation flow.
