Ciprian TEODOROV is a computer science researcher in [Lab-STICC Laboratory](https://labsticc.fr/en)/[P4S team](https://labsticc.fr/en/teams/p4s) at [ENSTA Bretagne](http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/). His main research interests are the industrialization of automata-based model-checking techniques for embedded system verification and model-driven design tools for reconfigurable system-on-chip. He leads the [OBP2 *Semantic Diagnosis & Formal Verification*](http://www.obpcdl.org) research team.

In the past he worked as EDA/CAD Software Engineer at [Dolphin Integration](http://www.dolphin.fr/), Meylan, France. His main responsibility was the implementation of a new, modern VHDL language infrastructure to increase standard compliance, to reduce memory consumption and to improve the simulation speed.

Ciprian TEODOROV received a PhD degree in Computer Science from the [University of Western Brittany](https://www.univ-brest.fr/), France. He was a member of the [“Methods, tools for circuits and systems” (MOCS)](http://www.labsticc.fr/les-equipes-cacs/mocs/) team of Lab-STICC. His research work focused on physical-design tools for nanoscale computing architectures.

During his PhD he created [R2D NASIC](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/NANOARCH.2011.5941486), a nanoscale architectural template, based on the NASIC fabric, which enables arbitrary placement and routing at nanoscale. He also designed MoNaDe, a model-driven physical-design framework. MoNade enables agile and incremental exploration of the architecture/design-tools adequacy.
